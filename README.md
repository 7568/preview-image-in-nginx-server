This is a chrome pluging. 

Sometimes we are build a http service for file system by use the nginx. If in some folders only contain images, then we visit it in chrome browse, we just see a file list,but can not watch the image directely.So I write this chrome plugging.


For example , blow is my file list in my service

Then we just click the plugging button , the list page will turn to image view page . We just onle click the plugging button again , the page can back.
